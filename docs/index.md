In Assignment 2 your group is expected to deliver an animated project based on the designs you have created for Assigmnet 1.

In this assigment you should show the application of the technologies discussed during the lectures and laboratories (or suggested through feedback) and experiment with them.

## Your project will be graded in four categories:
- Implementation
- Creative use of CSS
- Storytelling and User Experience
- Reflection over work and other required document

**To pass Assignemnt you need to pass all of the above categories.**

### What will be graded in above categories:
#### 1. Implementation
**SASS**

The group uses SASS actively and correctly (for example uses SASS Variables, nesting, uses mixing, function, extend if there is a place for that, uses partials and imports with reasonable naming, uses BEM, is following good coding practices - especially is avoiding css redundancy).

**GitHub**
- project is using GitHub as repository
- has well prepared Read me file
- project is published on GitHub pages

**extra points:**
- group were using Pull Requests during the development process

**Layout**
- Project is responsive, and correctly implements CSS Grid and Flexbox.

#### 2. Creative use of CSS
Do not limit yourself to the solutions presented in the lecture, build upon them.
- Realization of animation
- SMIL or CSS Animations, Transformations, Transitions or chosen framework or library
- Realization of graphic elements
- SVG or CSS Shapes or ClipPath
- Interesting use of space
- Creative placement of elements/typography with a use of CSS Grid / Flexbox / CSS Positioning / CSS Transitions
- Other creative use of CSS
- All creative CSS things that do not fit to above categories but still enhance the experience of the project
- The assignment should also include the technologies that will be covered on the next lecture (22 of March)

#### 3. User Experience and Storytelling
The story of the text is told/supported through CSS. The animations / effects are justified by artistic idea (not accidental or random). Overall feeling of the project.

#### 4. Reflection over work and other required document (screenshot of the results from the Lighthouse)
One page of reflection on your solutions and the process that lead you to them, you should also reflect on what you can improve further in order to delvier a better Assignment 3.

In the same document you should attach a screenshot of the Lighthouse results in Performance/Accessibility/Best Practices/SEO (the Lighthouse results itself is not graded, but yoou have to make a screenshot).

### Delivery
1. GitHub repository link,
2. GitHub pages link,
3. Group members and their GitHub usernames,
4. Two pages PDF with one page of reflection and on second page screenshot of Lighthouse result in Performance/Accessibility/Best Practices/SEO
